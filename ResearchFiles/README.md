============

So you're poking around my old experiments with OpenCV that led up to developing CommodityTracking, eh?

Frankly, there is nothing interesting here. I left this in the repo solely because I figured maybe it might interest someone, maybe.

Probably not. It'd be more work to take them out of git than keep them in their own seperate directory.

Anyways, to build them, use `g++ -o main main.cpp -lopencv_core -lopencv_highgui -lopencv_imgproc -O3` in each respective folder.

Otherwise, go up to the root directory for the actual framework.
